# Posit Arithmetic Library

## Prereqs

make
g++ (tested on 10.2)
C++17 or higher

## Testing

To test that everything's setup correctly, navigate to frac_tests and run `make add_test` to see a bunch of numerical outputs.  Then navigate to posit_tests and run `make display_test` to see a bunch of posit codes and their associated fractions

## Building the test suite

To build the python files used for testing, navigate to the desired _suite folder and run

`make all`

This should generate a bunch of `.py` files in test_bin, which can then be used for testing each associated component.

If make gets mad and says "nothing to be done" for a given file, the easiest fix is just to add and remove a space from target file, then save the file (this will mark a change as having been made)

Note: the double tests are generated by using the double operations of your computer, which are _not guaranteed_ to work exactly the same between machines (although they really should).  So if you get errors in the final hardware, make sure it's using the same algorithms as the generating computer.

## Building the timing suite

Building the timing suite is identical to building the test suite, just navigate to the appropriate folder and run `make all`.

Note: I decided to make the user navigate to each folder to avoid a gigantic top-level makefile that builds everything, since there's no need for an upfront CMake.
